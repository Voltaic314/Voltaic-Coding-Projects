# Wordle_Seeker
This is a program made by Logan Maupin aka Voltaic (on github & socials). I'm a computer science student at the University of Arizona Online. My goal with this project is to make word games like Lingo and Wordle a bit easier by suggesting all possible words the target word may be.

---------------------------

ABOUT THE GAME:
Wordle is a 5 letter game in which the goal is to guess five-letter words until you guess the right
word. But the game will tell you if some letters are in the word in general, or if not. If they are
in the word, the game will tell you if any of the letters in the word you guessed are in the same place
as the target word.

----------------------------

HOW TO USE THIS CODE: 

You will need the dictionary word list txt file I have provided otherwise the code will not work. So just download that dictionary txt file and put it in the same directory as the python script. Then run the python script and follow the prompts!

---------------------------

From my own statistical info gathering, Arise and Until are the best starting words because they use
the top 9 most used letters in the alphabet for five-letter words.

Thanks and have fun!
